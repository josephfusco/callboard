# Reads the canonical version from .release-please-manifest.json and syncs it
# into every place WordPress reads it verbatim:
#
#   - callboard.php plugin header `* Version:`
#   - callboard.php `CALLBOARD_VERSION` define
#   - readme.txt `Stable tag:`
#   - package.json and package-lock.json `version`
#
# It also writes readme.txt's `Tested up to:` from the current WordPress
# release. wp-env runs the suite against current core, so at release time that
# is the version the plugin was in fact tested on. Skipped quietly when
# api.wordpress.org cannot be reached.
#
# Called from .github/workflows/release-please.yml after release-please opens
# (or updates) its release pull request. Also runnable locally:
#
#   bash scripts/sync-versions.sh
#
# Each target line is grep-checked before the edit and verified afterwards so a
# miss fails loudly instead of shipping a half-bumped plugin.
